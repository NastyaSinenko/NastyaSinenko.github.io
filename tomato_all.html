            <h3>Seed preparation</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>To always have dill on your table, sow it during the spring and summer at intervals of 10-15 days. The last sowing in open ground is in mid-August. When sowing dry seeds, shoots will appear only after 20-25 days and only under the condition of constant high soil moisture. Slow germination of seeds does not allow for loosening and removing quickly appearing weeds.</strong></p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="program-card">
            <h3>Sowing</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>To ensure germination on the 4th-6th day, the seeds are soaked for 3 days to remove essential oils that prevent germination. Initially, the seeds in a cloth bag are washed for 2-3 minutes in a stream of hot water (60°C), and then placed in water at room temperature for 2-3 days. In this case, the water is changed 2-3 times a day, and the seeds are washed in running cold water. Before sowing, dry the seeds until they are loose.</strong> </p>

              Little tricks</h3>
            <hr>
            <p><strong>• do not add ash or lime before sowing, otherwise the dill will turn red and be thin - it likes slightly acidic soil;
              • do not sow it in shaded areas, where it stretches out, becomes pale, quickly begins to bolt, forming weak umbrellas with flowers;
              • when sowing, soak the furrows with a solution of mullein (1:10) or vermicompost;
              • the soil should always be moist to a depth of 15 cm</strong> </p>
